# EasyGame-Guess-the-number
The objective of this practice is to make a program of a game to guess a random number and have the statistics displayed at the end of the game. It has a text interface and was developed in C.

The computer must randomly generate a number between 1 and 100, and ask the user to try to guess it, each attempt must provide a clue as to whether the number is higher or lower, until it guesses it. Once guessed, it asks the user to guess a new number or can enter 0 to exit.

Before exiting, it should display a statistical summary with the number of games played, the best score, the lowest score and the average number of attempts for all games.
